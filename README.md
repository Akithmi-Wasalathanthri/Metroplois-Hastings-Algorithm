In this task, we implement the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, specifically the random walk Metropolis algorithm, to simulate random numbers from a distribution with the probability density function f(x)= 1/2 (exp(−∣x∣)).  The algorithm involves setting an initial value and then iteratively generates new values based on acceptance probabilities derived from the ratio of the target density function evaluated at proposed points to the current point. It involves N = 1000 iterations with a step size s = 1 for this simulation.

Upon generating the samples  we construct both a histogram and a kernel density plot to estimate f(x). These plots allow us to visualize how well the generated samples match the target distribution. Additionally, we compute the sample mean and standard deviation of the generated samples, which serve as Monte Carlo estimates of the mean and standard deviation, respectively. These statistics provide insights into the central tendency and spread of the simulated distribution.

In part (b), we evaluate the convergence of the algorithm using the Rb diagnostic, a measure of convergence commonly used in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. This involves generating multiple chains with different initial values, calculating sample means 𝑀𝑗 and within-chain variances 𝑉𝑗 for each chain 𝑗 and then computing overall sample statistics 𝑀,𝑊,𝐵, and 𝑅^. Specifically, we fix N = 2000 iterations, J=4 chains, and vary 𝑠 over a grid from 0.001 to 1. We plot the values of R^ across these 𝑠 values to assess how the choice of 𝑠 affects convergence, aiming for R^ values close to 1 to indicate good convergence properties of the algorithm.
